	abstract = {Scottish ballads were carried to isolated hamlets in the Appalachian Mountains of North America through successive waves of migration in the 17th and 18th centuries. The cultural diffusion of ballad singing underwent divergence as the songs were transmitted orally. Place names, local festivals, and current events were especially plastic components of this process. In the beginning of the 20th century, the intrusion of the radio and rural disturbances brought about by the coal industry functioned as barriers to cultural transmission of the ballads. Even so, songs were kept alive as evidenced by the metamorphosis of My Boy Tammie into Billy Boy and the more recent resurrection of The Elfin Knight into popular culture as Scarborough Fair by Simon and Garfunkel. The relationship between orality and literacy is multi‐faceted and difficult to categorise and evaluate.},

Any woman who dares to reveal her messy side has been treated as a cautionary tale. Today, unlikeable female characters are everywhere in film, {TV}, and wider pop culture. For the first time ever, they are being accepted by audiences and even showered with industry awards. We are finally accepting that women are—gasp—fully fledged human beings. How did we get to this point?Unlikeable Female Characters traces the evolution of highly memorable female characters, examining what exactly makes them popular, how audiences have reacted to them, and the ways in which pop culture is finally allowing us to celebrate the complexities of being a woman. Anna Bogutskaya, film programmer, broadcaster, and co-founder of the horror film collective and podcast The Final Girls, takes us on a journey through popular film, {TV}, and music, looking at the nuances of womanhood on and off-screen to reveal whether pop culture—and society—is finally ready to embrace complicated women.Praise for Unlikeable Female Characters:"Fascinating, insightful, and kick-ass." —Emma Jane Unsworth, internationally bestselling author of Grown Ups and Animals"Beautifully written." —Chelsea G.

Covering a wide range of topics, including oppressive images, \&quot;woman\&quot; as fetishized object of desire, female spectatorship, and the cinematic pleasures of black women and lesbian women, Feminist Film Theory is an indispensable reference for scholars and students in the field.

Featuring essays by leading and emerging voices in the field, the volume probes the contours and complexities of neoliberal capitalism across the globe and explores world cinema's situation within these forces by deploying and adapting Jamesonian concepts, and placing them in dialogue with other theoretical paradigms. The result is an innovative and rigorously analytical effort that offers a range of Marxist-inspired approaches towards cinemas from Asia, Latin America, Europe, and North America in the spirit of Jameson's famous rallying cry: 'always historicize!'.},

Alien 3 concludes the trilogy begun by Alien and Aliens; although each of the films has a different director, there is enough thematic unity between them to consider them a single work. Previous criticism has focussed on the implications for feminism in the role of the protagonist, Ripley, and in the presentation of images of the mother. This paper considers two further extensions of the image of the mother in these films: its connections to narrative and to mourning. The opening scenes of the first film thematize the connection between motherhood and narrative. But whereas the first two films are dominated by their narrative drive, the third film is more a meditation on guilt and mourning. Drawing on Jacques Derrida's treatment of mourning, this essay presents a reading of Alien 3 which suggests that the guilt Ripley feels as a "sole survivor" is incorporated as the "alien" inside her. The closing scenes of the film finally resolve, in an ironic mode, motifs that have been central to the wholes series.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            In his 1979 review, Vincent Canby calls Alien a “Gothic set in space”: in this chapter I will reflect upon the implications of describing the film as “Gothic,” arguing that the franchise engages with the traditions of the Female Gothic, specifically. The Female Gothic is typically defined by stories in which a central female protagonist is imperiled within isolated locations, usually because of a villainous male figure and/or patriarchal structures more broadly. Alien evokes this narrative patterning as the film comes to center on Ripley as the heroine, resisting the sexualized threat of the xenomorph in conjunction with the exploitative nature of the Company. These Female Gothic tropes continue to appear within the film’s larger franchise, following Ripley’s appearances in Aliens (1986), Alien3 (1992), and Alien Resurrection (1997). Indeed, when analyzing the franchise through the lens of the Female Gothic, it is fascinating to see how these four films—produced within varying historical contexts, with different filmmakers and diverse narrative set-ups—can be brought into a new dialogue, with the Female Gothic functioning as intertextual and transmedial structuring element. Revisiting the Alien franchise via the Female Gothic provides another way of considering these films together, illuminating both the continued cultural currency of the Female Gothic tradition, and Ripley as a screen icon.},

But the analytical tussle was hardly a genuine riot in as much the differing camps subscribed to a premise of authenticity in order to stabilise the work under a universal concept: the result was a Rite unified by theory. The scholars may have battled with each other, but the music was not allowed to have its own riot. This article suggests a more contingent analysis of the Rite, focussing on the rebellion of the particular against the universal. The point is not to champion an anarchic or barbaric reading of the music, which is often attributed to the work because of the ballet's violent content, but to open the possibility of a new order that arises from the rioting particular.},

Taking a number of critical-theoretical and philosophical approaches, Matthew Carter applies them to prominent forms of frontier historiography. He also considers the historiographic element of the Western by exploring the different ways in which the genre has responded to the issues raised by the frontier. Carter skilfully argues that the genre has - and continues to reveal - the complexities and contradictions at the heart of {US} society. With its clear analyses of and intellectual challenges to the film scholarship that has developed around the Western over a 65-year period, this book adds new depth to our understanding of specific film texts and of the genre as a whole - a welcome resource for students and scholars in both Film Studies and American Studies.},

More specifically, what he dubs the melodrama of the unknown woman, to his mind, provides an answer to the question of what a woman wants—namely, to be known. The Alien tetralogy, its prequels as well as its transmedial offshoots such as the survival horror video game Alien: Isolation, undoubtedly abound with strong female leads. In this contribution I aim to argue that not only that the first installment of Alien can be understood as a melodrama of an unknown woman set in space, but also that a similar description can be applied to its prequels and sequels as well as to the aforementioned video game. Discussing these films in terms of the desire to be known, I argue, also sheds light on the underlying horror in the Alien franchise—the fear of being known without being acknowledged.},

	abstract = {Sound is half the picture, and since the 1960s, film sound not only has rivaled the innovative imagery of contemporary Hollywood cinema, but in some ways has surpassed it in status and privilege because of the emergence of sound design. This in-depth study by William Whittington considers the evolution of sound design not only through cultural and technological developments during the last four decades, but also through the attitudes and expectations of filmgoers. Fans of recent blockbuster films, in particular science fiction films, have come to expect a more advanced and refined degree of film sound use, which has changed the way they experience and understand spectacle and storytelling in contemporary cinema. The book covers recent science fiction cinema in rich and compelling detail, providing a new sounding of familiar films, while offering insights into the constructed nature of cinematic sound design. This is accomplished by examining the formal elements and historical context of sound production in movies to better appreciate how a film sound track is conceived and presented.Whittington focuses on seminal science fiction films that have made specific advances in film sound, including 2001: A Space Odyssey, {THX} 1138, Star Wars, Alien, Blade Runner (original version and director's cut), Terminator 2: Judgment Day and The Matrix trilogy and games—milestones of the entertainment industry's technological and aesthetic advancements with sound. Setting itself apart from other works, the book illustrates through accessible detail and compelling examples how swiftly such advancements in film sound aesthetics and technology have influenced recent science fiction cinema, and examines how these changes correlate to the history, theory, and practice of contemporary Hollywood filmmaking.},

Bob Woodward, a journalist for the Washington Post, was called into the office on a Saturday morning to cover the story. Carl Bernstein, a political reporter on the Post, was also assigned. They soon learned this was no ordinary burglary. Following lead after lead, Woodward and Bernstein picked up a trail of money, conspiracy and high-level pressure that ultimately led to the doors of the Oval Office. Men very close to the President were implicated, and then Richard Nixon himself. Over a period of months, Woodward met secretly with Deep Throat, for decades the most famous anonymous source in the history of journalism. As he and Bernstein pieced the jigsaw together, they produced a series of explosive stories that would not only win the Post a Pulitzer Prize, they would bring about the President's scandalous downfall. {ALL} {THE} {PRESIDENT}'S {MEN} documents this amazing story.

	shorttitle = {Framing Blackness},
	abstract = {From D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation to Spike Lee's Malcolm X, Ed Guerrero argues, the commercial film industry reflects white domination of American society. Written with the energy and conviction generated by the new black film wave, Framing Blackness traces an ongoing epic—African Americans protesting screen images of blacks as criminals, servants, comics, athletes, and sidekicks. These images persist despite blacks' irrepressible demands for emancipated images and a role in the industry. Although starkly racist portrayals of blacks in early films have gradually been replaced by more appealing characterizations, the legacy of the plantation genre lives on in Blaxpoitation films, the fantastic racialized imagery in science fiction and horror films, and the resubordination of blacks in Reagan-era films. Probing the contradictions of such images, Guerrero recalls the controversies surrounding role choices by stars like Sidney Poitier, Eddie Murphy, Whoopie Goldberg, and Richard Pryor. Throughout his study, Guerrero is attentive to the ways African Americans resist Hollywood's one-dimensional images and superficial selling of black culture as the latest fad. Organizing political demonstrations and boycotts, writing, and creating their own film images are among the forms of active resistance documented. The final chapter awakens readers to the artistic and commercial breakthrough of black independent filmmakers who are using movies to channel their rage at social injustice. Guerrero points out their diverse approaches to depicting African American life and hails innovative tactics for financing their work. Framing Blackness is the most up-to-date critical study of how African Americans are acquiring power once the province of Hollywood alone: the power of framing blackness.

While theory may be out of the limelight, it remains an essential key to understanding the full complexity of cinema, one that should not be so easily discounted or discarded.  In this volume, contributors explore recent popular movies through the lens of film theory, beginning with industrial-economic analysis before moving into a predominately aesthetic and interpretive framework. The Hollywood films discussed cover a wide range from 300 to Fifty First Dates, from Brokeback Mountain to Lord of the Rings, from Spider-Man 3 to Fahrenheit 9/11, from Saw to Raiders of the Lost Ark, and much more. Individual essays consider such topics as the rules that govern new blockbuster franchises, the ‘posthumanist realism’ of digital cinema, video game adaptations, increasingly restricted stylistic norms, the spatial stories of social networks like {YouTube}, the mainstreaming of queer culture, and the cognitive paradox behind enjoyable viewing of traumatic events onscreen.  With its cast of international film scholars, Film Theory and Contemporary Hollywood Movies demonstrates the remarkable contributions theory can offer to film studies and moviegoers alike.},

How does it follow or depart from tradition? How does it represent the strengths and foibles of its composer? The book includes discussion of trend-setting work such as Max Steiner's King Kong (1933--an early instance of music carrying a significant portion of onscreen action), Bernard Herrmann's Psycho (1960, with its unusual, high, scraping strings-only support of the famous shower scene), and Alex North's A Streetcar Named Desire (1951--the first essentially jazz-oriented score), as well as remarks on the work that followed within the resulting trends. Discussions are enhanced by musical reproductions of significant themes and motives. Chapters on 14 individual composers working largely within the United States are given perspective by summary chapters on the silent and early sound years, the decades 1930-1980, and the work of composers outside the United States.},

	abstract = {This book bridges the existing gap between film sound and film music studies by bringing together scholars from both disciplines who challenge the constraints of their subject areas by thinking about integrated approaches to the soundtrack. As the boundaries between scoring and sound design in contemporary cinema have become increasingly blurred, both film music and film sound studies have responded by expanding their range of topics and the scope of their analysis beyond those traditionally addressed. The running theme of the book is the disintegration of boundaries, which permeates discussions about industry, labour, technology, aesthetics and audiovisual spectatorship. The collaborative nature of screen media is addressed not only in scholarly chapters but also through interviews with key practitioners that include sound recordists, sound designers, composers, orchestrators and music supervisors who honed their skills on films, {TV} programmes, video games, commercials and music videos.},

	series = {Oxford Music / Media},
	abstract = {A theory of the soundtrack is concerned with what belongs to the soundtrack, how a soundtrack is effectively organized, how its status in a multimedia object affects the nature of the object, the tools available for its analysis, and the interpretive regime that the theory mandates for determining the meaning, sense, and structure that sound and music bring to film and other audiovisual media. Beyond that, a theory may also delineate the range of possible uses of sound and music, classify the types of relations that films have used for image and sound, identify the central problems, and reflect on and describe effective uses of sound in film. This book summarizes and critiques major theories of the soundtrack from roughly 1929 until today. Rather than providing an exhaustive historical survey, it sketches out the range of theoretical approaches that have been applied to the soundtrack since the commercial introduction of the sound film. The basic theoretical framework of each approach is presented, taking into account the explicit and implicit claims about the soundtrack and its relation to other theories. The organization is both chronological and topical, the former in that the chapters move steadily from early film theory through models of the classical system to more recent critical theories; the latter in that the chapters highlight central issues for each generation: the problem of film itself, then of image and sound, of adequate analytical-descriptive models, and finally of critical-interpretative models.

	abstract = {The musical leitmotif, having reached a point of particular forcefulness in the music of Richard Wagner, has remained a popular compositional device up to the present day. In this book, Matthew Bribitzer-Stull explores the background and development of the leitmotif, from Wagner to the Hollywood adaptations of The Lord of The Rings and the Harry Potter series. Analyzing both concert music and film music, Bribitzer-Stull explains what the leitmotif is and establishes it as the union of two aspects: the thematic and the associative. He goes on to show that Wagner's Ring cycle provides a leitmotivic paradigm, a model from which we can learn to better understand the leitmotif across style periods. Arguing for a renewed interest in the artistic merit of the leitmotif, Bribitzer-Stull reveals how uniting meaning, memory, and emotion in music can lead to a richer listening experience and a better understanding of dramatic music's enduring appeal.},

	abstract = {Scope and method of study. A review of literature concerning the John Wayne Syndrome was initiated in the Spring of 1990. Dr. Reiser, a psychologist with the Los Angeles Police Department was identified as the probable researcher that first identified the syndrome and established the significant identifiers. Reiser was contacted, as were other researchers and the necessary identifiers of the syndrome along with some possible contributors were identified. A survey instrument that gathered certain demographic and personal information about line officers was developed and tested. A plan to gather the data on the instrument through police supervisors attending the {FBI} National Academy, in Quantico, Virginia was developed and concluded.
Findings and conclusions. An analysis of the returned questionnaires indicated that only the size of the department was significant, using the Chi-square test at the.05 level in predicting whether or not an officer might experience the John Wayne Syndrome. Officers in the medium and larger departments (more than 50 commissioned officers) were less likely to have the syndrome than those in the small departments. Although the other five characteristics were not significant at the.05 level the frequency charts did indicate fewer officers (by percentage of the total) with the syndrome who participated regularly in sports or fitness activities. The same was true of those officers who had completed a course on handling stress. There was no significant difference between males and females in the Chi-square test or in the percent of occurrence. The same was true for those officers with less than two years of education and those with more than two years of education. Similarly, the age of the officer seemed to make no difference in predicting the onset of the syndrome.},

	shorttitle = {Hegemonic Masculinity},
	abstract = {Donald J. Trump’s history-making ascension from nonpolitician to president of the United States has been attributed to the antiestablishment, antielitist, and nativist populism of Trump voters, as well as to sexism, racism, homophobia, and xenophobia. Based on the findings of seven studies involving 2,007 people, men’s and women’s endorsement of hegemonic masculinity predicted support for Trump over and beyond the aforementioned factors, even when controlling for political party affiliation. Results highlight the importance of looking beyond social identity–based conceptualizations of masculinity to fully consider how men’s and women’s endorsement of cultural ideologies about masculinity legitimate patriarchal forms of dominance and reify gender-, race-, and class-based hierarchies., This work examined whether the endorsement of the culturally idealized form of masculinity—hegemonic masculinity ({HM})—accounted for unique variance in men’s and women’s support for Donald Trump across seven studies (n = 2,007). Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, in the days (Studies 1 and 2) and months (Studies 3 through 6) following the 2016 American presidential election, women’s and men’s endorsement of {HM} predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents’ trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, as conceptualized, {HM} was associated with less trust in the government (Study 3), more sexism (Study 4), more racism (Study 5), and more xenophobia (Study 6) but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. Whereas {HM} predicted evaluations of Trump, across studies, social and prejudiced attitudes predicted evaluations of his democratic challengers: Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020. We replicate the findings of Studies 1 through 6 using a nationally representative sample of the United States (Study 7) 50 days prior to the 2020 presidential election. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men’s and women’s endorsement of {HM} legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support.},

It ascertains the fundamental compositional characteristics of this body of work, while drawing out their salience against a range of historical and theoretical contexts: music in the western, Italian cinema, Morricone’s life and wider practice, and film-scoring technique. Beyond the necessary outlining of contextual developments and a largely chronological survey of the works that play host to Morricone’s engagement with the genre, the enquiry is thematically structured, exploring the nature and significance of these characteristics as they manifest within the filmography. The essential aim of the study is to understand Morricone’s relationship with the genre. While this is a notion conventionally alluded to in discussions of Sergio Leone’s cinema, the thesis expands the discourse beyond this limited filmography to include the entirety of Morricone’s experience composing music for westerns, putting the composer’s practice front and centre.},

Following the neo-Riemannian work of theorists such as David Kopp and Richard Cohn, and film-music theorists such as Scott Murphy and Frank Lehman, I propose a lexicon of harmonic motions and associative connotations. The article provides a survey of both major-mode and minor-mode chromatic mediant relationships in as many different genres of film as possible, with science-fiction and fantasy films being most common. Through this survey I aim to demonstrate not only the extent to which chromatic mediants have become staple devices of film-scoring harmonic practice, with meanings so consistent that they can be subverted for ironic and satirical purposes, but also to lay out a speculative path for future film-music theorists to use these connotations in additional film contexts.},

The emphasis is on explaining chromatic third relations and the pivotal role they play in theory and practice. The book traces conceptions of harmonic system and of chromatic third relations from Rameau through nineteenth-century theorists such as Marx, Hauptmann and Riemann, to the seminal twentieth-century theorists Schenker and Schoenberg and on to the present day. Drawing on tenets of nineteenth-century harmonic theory, contemporary transformation theory and the author's own approach, the book presents a clear and elegant means for characterizing commonly acknowledged but loosely defined elements of chromatic harmony, and integrates them as fully fledged entities into a chromatically based conception of harmonic system. The historical and theoretical argument is supplemented by plentiful analytic examples.},

In addition, ascending tones (from the C major scale) were rated as being happier, brighter, faster and as speeding up more than descending tones (from the C major scale). In addition to these main effects, there are a number of interactions on ratings indicating that some characteristics of music may combine in different ways to produce different perceptions of music.

	abstract = {Pitch is a fundamental musical factor; however, findings about its contribution to the elicitation of emotions are contradictory. The purpose of this work was to assess the effect of systematic pitch variations on self-reports of felt valence and arousal. In a within-subject design, 49 subjects listened to four 1-minute classical piano excerpts, each presented at three different pitch levels (one octave lower than the original version, the original version and one octave higher than the original version). Compared to excerpts both without octave modification and in the +1 octave variant, pleasantness of excerpts in the -1 octave variant was significantly lower. This main effect was stronger for women than men and, importantly, was modulated by the specific characteristics of the stimuli. There was also a significant, yet smaller, negative relationship between pitch level and arousal, moderated by gender: Compared to higher pitch, lower pitch was associated with higher arousal in men only. Regarding the complex outcomes of this study, future studies should investigate to which extent our findings can be generalized to other musical works. The ultimate goal might be to demonstrate how pitch level interacts with other musical features and listeners’ characteristics in eliciting diverse affective experiences.},

	abstract = {In this experiment, participants (nonmusicians) heard pairs of melodies and had to judge which of the two melodies was happier. Each pair consisted of a single melody presented in two different diatonic modes (Lydian, Ionian, Mixolydian, Dorian, Aeolian, or Phrygian) with a constant tonic of C; all pairs of modes were used. The results suggest that modes imply increasing happiness as scale-degrees are raised, with the exception of Lydian, which is less happy than Ionian. Overall, the results are best explained by familiarity: Ionian (major mode), the most common mode in both classical and popular music, is the happiest, and happiness declines with increasing distance from Ionian. However, familiarity does not entirely explain our results. Familiarity predicts that Mixolydian would be happier than Lydian (since they are equally similar to Ionian, and Mixolydian is much more common in popular music); but for almost half of our participants, the reverse was true. This suggests that the “sharpness” of a mode also affects its perceived happiness, either due to pitch height or to the position of the scale relative to the tonic on the “line of fifths”; we favor the latter explanation.},

Even though early writers were apt to condemn these effects, it is clear that soloists were using them very early, partly in imitation of the singer's port de voix or cercar la nota, and that orchestral players, in spite of much criticism, were adopting them in the early nineteenth century. The advent of the universal portamento is marked by Bériot's Méthode de violon (1858) and, apparently, by Schumann's orchestral slow movements of the 1840s, which are obviously designed for the B-glissando. As an aspect both of performance and composition, it qualifies as a musical topic whose historical birth and development can be traced.},

This study explores the implications of utopian thought, and Adorno's claim, for scoring practices in small- and big-screen science-fiction repertoire across the spectrum of artistic and commercial aspirations.},

	shorttitle = {Instrument Timbre},
	abstract = {An instrument’s timbre is one of the determining factors in the decision to play it. Previous studies have shown gender stereotypes of certain instruments, and personality differences among musicians playing specific instruments. The present study was conducted with 2 aims: first, to examine whether nonmusicians hold the same stereotypes of instrumentalists as musicians; second, to examine whether hearing a melody in different instrumental timbres influences trait attribution to the assumed performers. To examine the first question, 26 nonmusicians and 22 musicians (control groups) rated flautists, trumpet players, and violinists on a list of 10 personality traits. Nonmusicians rated trumpet players as less introverted and sensitive than flautists and violinists. Musicians rated trumpet players as tougher than flautists and violinists, and violinists were rated as more egocentric than trumpet players or flautists. In the second phase, 80 participants (experimental groups) rated fictional musicians after hearing the same melody played in the 3 timbres, presented in different orders. Results show that trumpet timbre led to significantly different attributions from flute or violin. Trumpet players were generally rated more extraverted, friendly, tough, and assertive, and less introverted, anxious, sensitive, and shy. Finally, comparisons between control and experimental groups showed significant differences in ratings. Results demonstrate the strong effect of hearing instruments’ timbre on trait attribution. However, these effects were different for the different instruments. Whereas nonmusicians do not hold the same stereotypes of instrumentalists as musicians, hearing a melody in the 3 different timbres led to ratings in the direction of gender stereotypes.

According to previous research, a variety of musical instruments are categorized or rated as masculine, neutral, or feminine in a relatively consistent way. Gender associations to musical instruments have been rather reliable across time and across participant populations. We investigated the gender ratings of nine musical instruments (three masculine, three neutral, and three feminine) each heard at low, medium, and high pitch levels within the playable range of each instrument. Both timbre and pitch level influenced participants’ gender ratings. The effect of timbre is consistent with results of previous studies, further demonstrating that participants rate instruments fairly consistently. One novel finding is that pitch level also played a role in participants’ gender ratings. The ratings of all instruments heard in low pitch levels were shifted in the masculine direction, and the ratings of all instruments heard in high pitch levels were shifted in the feminine direction. These results provide evidence for the notion that participants are influenced by associations to both timbre and pitch level when rating musical instruments on gender.},

	abstract = {From work songs and spirituals during slavery to the gospel, soul, and funk of the civil rights movement, Black music offers a new historicist interpretation of the African American experience. Through Black popular music, the struggles, faith, and joys of a people are expressed. More than mere entertainers, Black musicians are the village griots, the revisionist historians, and the voice of a people. African American music solidifies messages of societal concerns, offering snapshots of social conditions and defining moments within a society. This research posits that funk music was the social protest discourse of poor and working-class Black youth after the euphoria of the civil rights movement faded in “the decade of the detached.” Music accompanied many prominent protest movements, including the civil rights and Black power movements. But with an apparent lull in protest activities in the 1970s and 1980s, research focused on the previous decade, leaving an absence of immediate post—civil rights scholarship. While large mainstream social protest movements were less apparent, a counter protest movement emerged through the rhetorical means of funk music. This form of creative communication used everyday experiences to challenge the dominant power structure and ideology of the time period. Consciously or unconsciously, the work of funk musicians recognized language as a form of social control, thus ending their blind consent to manipulation through language by developing a counterdiscourse that challenged accepted social norms. The functional approach to rhetorical social movements is applied to further support this claim.},

	shorttitle = {Designing Sound},
	abstract = {The late 1960s and 1970s are widely recognized as a golden age for American film, as directors like Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, and Martin Scorsese expanded the Hollywood model with aesthetically innovative works. As this groundbreaking new study reveals, those filmmakers were blessed with more than just visionary eyes; \textit{Designing Sound} focuses on how those filmmakers also had keen ears that enabled them to perceive new possibilities for cinematic sound design.  Offering detailed case studies of key films and filmmakers, Jay Beck explores how sound design was central to the era's experimentation with new modes of cinematic storytelling. He demonstrates how sound was key to many directors' signature aesthetics, from the overlapping dialogue that contributes to Robert Altman's naturalism to the wordless interludes at the heart of Terrence Malick's lyricism. Yet the book also examines sound design as a collaborative process, one where certain key directors ceded authority to sound technicians who offered significant creative input.   \textit{Designing Sound} provides readers with a fresh take on a much-studied era in American film, giving a new appreciation of how artistry emerged from a period of rapid industrial and technological change. Filled with rich behind-the-scenes details, the book vividly conveys how sound practices developed by 1970s filmmakers changed the course of American cinema.},

	shorttitle = {Williams Versus Wagner},
	abstract = {The claims of various analysts, and actually of the persons involved in the creation of the music for the old Star Wars trilogy, John Williams and George Lucas, have led the writer of this paper to seek for links between the operas of Richard Wagner and the music of John Williams for the Star Wars sequence. The link between the two composers can be seen at first in the use of the leitmotif. Wagner's idea of the leitmotif, that is of a musical thought that is reiterated throughout the work, linked with some character, concept, object or idea, frequently appears in film music. But since film composers address the leitmotif much more simplistically than Wagner, their running motifs are better referred to as film themes. Nevertheless, John Williams used leitmotifs in the genuine sense of the word. He has come very close to the practice of Wagner in the various procedures in which he varies and transforms his themes, and in using the idea of the thematic image (the arch-theme that is the unifying element of the musical material). However, the similarity of Williams's and Wagner's leitmotifs is greatest in the area of kinship of themes (a series of new themes or motifs derive from a single motif or theme) on the basis of which both of them create a web of mutually related leitmotifs. The closeness of the procedures of the two can also be found in the area of melody, rhythm, form, harmony, instrumentation, and even in the domain of the ratio of the old and the new in their music. The ultimate objective of Richard Wagner was to create the music drama, music for the stage based on the old roots of opera, in which all the musical elements were subordinated to the drama. The ultimate aim of John Williams was to take part in the creation of a film in which his music would serve to define the film's substance and help all the other elements of it to function property.},

	abstract = {It is often assumed that musical soundtracks influence the interpretation of film. Film music theorists further assume that such musical influences depend on the combination of meanings derived from musical and film material. The present article suggests that these assumptions about film music fall within an associationist tradition and translate into testable hypotheses about mental function. This view is supported first by a discussion of the reliance of musical meaning on experience and then by a review of three recent experiments which investigate the influence of music on film meaning. Experiment 1 uses simple musical and visual materials and measures one affective meaning at a time. Experiment 2 uses slightly more complex materials and measures multiple scales of affective meaning employing the semantic differential technique. Experiment 3 uses realistic complex materials and measures both affective and denotative meaning. In all studies, the direct influence of musical meaning on film meaning was often observed. To accommodate the data, it is proposed that musical and film information independently activate associations of both affect and denotation and that meaning at any point in time is the resultant of the total associations generated. This foundation provides a basis for examining further assumptions and hypotheses about the functions of film music, thus revealing facts about film music necessary for future cognitive modelling.},

Patton. Indeed, as Peter Lev persuasively argues in this book, the films of the 1970s constitute a kind of conversation about what American society is and should be—open, diverse, and egalitarian, or stubbornly resistant to change.  Examining forty films thematically, Lev explores the conflicting visions presented in films with the following kinds of subject matter:  Hippies (Easy Rider, Alice's Restaurant) Cops (The French Connection, Dirty Harry) Disasters and conspiracies (Jaws, Chinatown) End of the Sixties (Nashville, The Big Chill) Art, Sex, and Hollywood (Last Tango in Paris) Teens (American Graffiti, Animal House) War (Patton, Apocalypse Now) African-Americans (Shaft, Superfly) Feminisms (An Unmarried Woman, The China Syndrome) Future visions (Star Wars, Blade Runner) As accessible to ordinary moviegoers as to film scholars, Lev's book is an essential companion to these familiar, well-loved movies.},

This juxtaposition between sequels and prequels allows us to take into account the temporal implications of serialization on representation. Our consideration of motherhood across the series hence acknowledges the complexities of (multiple) origins in serialized narratives. We explore how motherhood is rendered the site of gender negotiation in the Alien series and argue that the mechanics of serialization at play—with the film pairs themselves constituting sequels while the first pair also functions as a prequel in the overall trajectory of the series—are used to retroactively infuse the original series with female agency. By focusing on procreation and creation as the films’ central discursive paradigms, we show that mothers in the Alien series are as much creators of alien lifeforms as they are creations of an abusive system based on asymmetrically expressed gender and power relations.},

@thesis{minnick_distant_2022,
	title = {Distant Ecologies: Sci-Fi Film Scores and the Music of the Final Frontier},
	shorttitle = {Distant Ecologies},
	abstract = {In 1950, sci-fi entered its Golden Age in Hollywood with film premieres that established sci-fi as a major cinematic genre. These films, however, sounded dramatically different from other films at the time, as sci-fi’s extraterrestrial settings and characters encouraged composers to experiment with their scores and distance themselves from the classical Hollywood style. This dissertation investigates science fiction films from the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, which I believe are the most decisive decades in the development of cinematic science fiction. Film music scholar Vivian Sobchack wrote in 1987 that sci-fi lacked a notable sound compared to genres like westerns and noirs, but through these three decades, I show that composers not only experimented in their scores, but also established cliches and tropes that would define the sound of sci-fi and used these associations to construct the soundworlds of outer space. My ecomusicological study of Destination Moon (1950), Rocketship X-M (1950), The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), Forbidden Planet (1956), Planet of the Apes (1968), Alien (1979), Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979), and Star Wars (the original trilogy) pushes the boundaries of ecomusicology to the distant ecologies of outer space. By studying the interaction between these scores—which included electronic instruments like the theremin and state-of-the-art synthesizers, serialism, primitivism, unfamiliar timbres, and several other unconventional Hollywood practices—and distant ecologies, charting a new area in the Final Frontier for film music scholars and ecomusicologists to explore. While composers like Ferde Grofé, Bebe Barron, and Jerry Goldsmith paid close attention to how their scores represented outer space landscapes, these films also explored a variety of social and cultural critiques, many of which are ecological and related to the developments of the Space Race and the Cold War. Firstly, I explore the ambivalent attitudes toward technology. These films celebrate our ability to travel to distant planets but critique nuclear weaponry and its capability for immense ecological destruction. I show that composers often paired strange timbres and unconventional instruments with outer space settings and aliens, suggesting that we should be frightened by advanced technology. On the other hand, more conventional, swashbuckling themes conjured feelings of excitement and adventure at the prospect of exploring other planets and galaxies. Secondly, many films present a blurry mechanical-biological binary. I show that characters like Robby the Robot, Darth Vader, C-3PO, and the Krell complicate the distinction between man and machine, and that the Barrons’s life-like cybernetic sound circuits for Forbidden Planet further blur the mechanical-biological binary, for example through Ben Burtt’s processing of organic sounds to create inorganic sound effects. Lastly, I examine issues related to imperialism on the Final Frontier. The human interaction with other planets and extraterrestrials evokes the concepts of manifest destiny and imperialism, which map onto varied narratives of conflict between humans and extraterrestrials. Through my analysis of these films, I show that extraterrestrials are sonically “othered” using electronic instruments, atonality, or strange timbres, standing in sharp contrast to the conventional Hollywood orchestra, representing the familiar and the human.},

	abstract = {Robin Wood's writing on the horror film, published over five decades, collected in one volume. Robin Wood--one of the foremost critics of cinema--has laid the groundwork for anyone writing about the horror film in the last half-century. Wood's interest in horror spanned his entire career and was a form of popular cinema to which he devoted unwavering attention. Robin Wood on the Horror Film: Collected Essays and Reviews compiles over fifty years of his groundbreaking critiques. In September 1979, Wood and Richard Lippe programmed an extensive series of horror films for the Toronto International Film Festival and edited a companion piece: The American Nightmare: Essays on the Horror Film -- the first serious collection of critical writing on the horror genre. Robin Wood on the Horror Film now contains all of Wood's writings from The American Nightmare and nearly everything else he wrote over the years on horror--published in a range of journals and magazines--gathered together for the first time. It begins with the first essay Wood ever published, "Psychoanalysis of Psycho," which appeared in 1960 and already anticipated many of the ideas explored later in his touchstone book, Hitchcock's Films. The volume ends, fittingly, with, "What Lies Beneath?," written almost five decades later, an essay in which Wood reflects on the state of the horror film and criticism since the genre's renaissance in the 1970s. Wood's prose is eloquent, lucid, and convincing as he brings together his parallel interests in genre, authorship, and ideology. Deftly combining Marxist, Freudian, and feminist theory, Wood's prolonged attention to classic and contemporary horror films explains much about the genre's meanings and cultural functions. Robin Wood on the Horror Film will be an essential addition to the library of anyone interested in horror, science fiction, and film genre.},

	abstract = {\textit{Sounding New Media} examines the long-neglected role of sound and audio in the development of new media theory and practice, including new technologies and performance art events, with particular emphasis on sound, embodiment, art, and technological interactions. Frances Dyson takes an historical approach, focusing on technologies that became available in the mid-twentieth century-electronics, imaging, and digital and computer processing-and analyzing the work of such artists as John Cage, Edgard Varèse, Antonin Artaud, and Char Davies. She utilizes sound's intangibility to study ideas about embodiment (or its lack) in art and technology as well as fears about technology and the so-called "post-human." Dyson argues that the concept of "immersion" has become a path leading away from aesthetic questions about meaning and toward questions about embodiment and the physical.

	abstract = {Wide Angle 21.4 (1999) 20-41 , , On August 11, 1965, violence broke out in the Watts section of Los Angeles, the result of an incident between officers from the {LAPD} and an African American man named Marquette Frye. Faced with another instance of police brutality, the predominantly black community rebelled against the police presence, the prevailing poverty, and the government disinterest that had long defined and limited life in Southcentral Los Angeles. Watts burned over the next six days as the nation and the world viewed televised coverage of the rebellion while hearing reports of rioters "run[ing] loose, looting, burning, and rampaging."1 Following the Watts rebellion, urban insurrections occurred again in 1967 and 1968 in cities including Newark, Detroit, and Chicago. Unlike earlier racially-motivated uprisings—from the teens or the forties, for example—the urban rebellions from the sixties were nationally televised. They acted as a warp in the United States' racial repressed by bringing to the surface [End Page 21] white America's deeply-buried fears of African American aggression with footage remarkably resembling Birth of a Nation's(D. W. Griffith, 1915) infamous images of Reconstruction-era looting and rampaging. For white suburbia these images defined the black ghetto.2 The broadcasts served a different purpose, however, for many African American spectators who saw resistance to the specific wrongs, such as poverty, decay, and unchecked police brutality, faced by residents of the inner city.3 In contrast to earlier problem picture depictions of race relations that graced movie screens in the fifties and early sixties or news coverage of Civil Rights protests, the newscasts redefined the images of African Americans on screen for both blacks and whites., By the end of the sixties, televisual images of inner city anger and despair were supplemented by new representations of African American city space introduced into mainstream cinematic discourse in the form of the short-lived, though influential, blaxploitation, or black action, genre. Serving as the precursor to the genre, Melvin Van Peebles' independent feature, Sweet Sweet—back's Baadasssss Song (1971), introduced many of blaxploitation's conventions, such as an empowered black masculinity, on-location shooting in recognizable city spaces, and a sense of temporal immediacy aided by costume, dialogue, and musical soundtrack. More "mainstream" blaxploitation vehicles, such as Shaft (Gordon Parks, 1971),quickly appropriated these features into their narratives. Inspired by the financial success of Sweetback, the Shafts, Superflies, and Dolemites that followed became box office hits, especially with an audience that was primarily (though not limited to) young, urban, African American men. At the same time however, their images, like Sweetback's before them, were highly contested, as both black and white critics opposed the films' glorification of criminal life. Soon, religious and political groups such as the Coalition Against Blaxploitation ({CAB}) were demanding more "realistic" representations of black life in film, and the pressure exerted on the industry by these groups (as well as an industrial shift towards blockbuster and crossover films) resulted in the eventual disappearance of blaxploitation productions., Emerging on the periphery of both Hollywood and blaxploitation was a group of filmmakers working under the auspices of the film program in the Theater Arts Department at {UCLA}. This group, variously referred to as the "L.A. [End Page 22] Rebellion" and the "L.A. School of Filmmakers," was made up of African and African American graduate film students and included Haile Gerima, Ntongela Masilela, Larry Clark, Billy Woodberry, Alile Sharon Larkin, Julie Dash, Zeinabu irene Davis, and Charles Burnett, among others. Unlike many of the African American filmmakers working within the mainstream, members of the L.A. School expressed an explicitly political agenda that extended beyond profit-making and...},

With the saga’s final installment, he has delivered yet another stunning literary and historical achievement.  In late 1976, Ronald Reagan was dismissed as a man without a political future: defeated in his nomination bid against a sitting president of his own party, blamed for President Gerald Ford’s defeat, too old to make another run. His comeback was fueled by an extraordinary confluence: fundamentalist preachers and former segregationists reinventing themselves as militant crusaders against gay rights and feminism; business executives uniting against regulation in an era of economic decline; a cadre of secretive “New Right” organizers deploying state-of-the-art technology, bending political norms to the breaking point—and Reagan’s own unbending optimism, his ability to convey unshakable confidence in America as the world’s “shining city on a hill.” Meanwhile, a civil war broke out in the Democratic party. When President Jimmy Carter called Americans to a new ethic of austerity, Senator Ted Kennedy reacted with horror, challenging him for reelection. Carter’s Oval Office tenure was further imperiled by the Iranian hostage crisis, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, near-catastrophe at a Pennsylvania nuclear plant, aviation accidents, serial killers on the loose, and endless gas lines.  Backed by a reenergized conservative Republican base, Reagan ran on the campaign slogan “Make America Great Again”—and prevailed. Reaganland is the story of how that happened, tracing conservatives’ cutthroat strategies to gain power and explaining why they endure four decades later.},

Out of its ashes, the political world we know today was born. Nixonland begins in the blood and fire of the Watts riots-one week after President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, and nine months after his historic landslide victory over Barry Goldwater seemed to have heralded a permanent liberal consensus. The next year scores of liberals were thrown out of Congress, America was more divided than ever-and a disgraced politician was on his way to a shocking comeback: Richard Nixon. Six years later, President Nixon, harvesting the bitterness and resentment borne of that blood and fire, was reelected in a landslide even bigger than Johnson\&\#39;s, and the outlines of today\&\#39;s politics of red-and-blue division became already distinct. Cataclysms tell the story of Nixonland: • Angry blacks burning down their neighborhoods, while suburbanites defend home and hearth with shotguns. • The civil war over Vietnam, the assassinations, the riot at the Democratic National Convention. • Richard Nixon acceding to the presidency pledging a new dawn of national unity--and governing more divisively than any before him. • The rise of twin cultures of left- and right-wing vigilantes, Americans literally bombing and cutting each other  down in the streets over political differences. •And, finally, Watergate, the fruit of a president who rose by matching his own anxieties and dreads with those of an increasingly frightened electorate--but whose anxieties and dreads produced a criminal conspiracy in the Oval Office.},

	abstract = {From the bestselling author of Nixonland: a dazzling portrait of America on the verge of a nervous breakdown in the tumultuous political and economic times of the 1970s.In January of 1973 Richard Nixon announced the end of the Vietnam War and prepared for a triumphant second term—until televised Watergate hearings revealed his White House as little better than a mafia den. The next president declared upon Nixon’s resignation “our long national nightmare is over”—but then congressional investigators exposed the {CIA} for assassinating foreign leaders. The collapse of the South Vietnamese government rendered moot the sacrifice of some 58,000 American lives. The economy was in tatters. And as Americans began thinking about their nation in a new way—as one more nation among nations, no more providential than any other—the pundits declared that from now on successful politicians would be the ones who honored this chastened new national mood. Ronald Reagan never got the message. Which was why, when he announced his intention to challenge President Ford for the 1976 Republican nomination, those same pundits dismissed him—until, amazingly, it started to look like he just might win. He was inventing the new conservative political culture we know now, in which a vision of patriotism rooted in a sense of American limits was derailed in America’s Bicentennial year by the rise of the smiling politician from Hollywood. Against a backdrop of melodramas from the Arab oil embargo to Patty Hearst to the near-bankruptcy of America’s greatest city, The Invisible Bridge asks the question: what does it mean to believe in America? To wave a flag—or to reject the glibness of the flag wavers?},
